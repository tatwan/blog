This blog belongs to **Tarek Atwan**.I bring over 15 years of experience in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Product Development. 

I am passionate about Coding, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies, Cloud Computing, Web Development and Mobile Development. I enjoy coding in `Python`, `Julia`, `R`, and `JavaScript`. 

In addition to blogging, I also intend to use this blog as a way to publish some of my notes (markdown and jupyter notebooks).
